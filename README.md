# tmap
tmap is a very fast visualization library for large, high-dimensional data sets. Currently, tmap is available for `Python`. tmaps graph layouts are based on the [OGDF](https://ogdf.uos.de/) library. **The goal of this project is to make the `C++` library accessable through a native `R` interface.**
